<h2>Convention Over Configuration</h2>

<ol>
<li>Convention for configuration</li>
<li><p>All micro configuration files are to be placed under the source/config folder
with a .erb extension suffix after their real extension. This will allow expansion
to occur.</p></li>
<li><p>Test Naming Convention</p></li>
<li>All tests for a component X will be in a file name XSpecs.cs. And that file will contain an outer class with the same name as the file, which all contexts will live under.</li>
</ol>
